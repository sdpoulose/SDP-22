        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>Thanks for visiting our website! We are a group of computer science and engineering undergraduate students and this is our senior design project at the University of Connecticut. Our project uses machine learning to create a model that can determine a predicted epidemic risk of a geographical area in the United States based on opioid epidemic data from prior years and social determinants for the corresponding geographies. As a diverse team of different computer science concentrations, we were excited from the start to have the opportunity to create and design a project with potential impact.</p>
          
        <h2>Cigna</h2>
        <p>Cigna is a global health service company based in Bloomfield, Connecticut and serves as the project’s sponsor. Cigna offers both medicare and medicaid products, as well as life and accidental insurance, and runs a health maintenance organization. With roughly 3.6 million people covered in the United States and 8 million more in countries around the world, Cigna is committed to improving the health and well-being of their customers. </p><p>A key part of Cigna's mission is to fight the opioid epidemic. They are actively taking steps to reduce their customers' opioid use by 25%. To achieve this, Cigna is tapping into its extensive experience with prevention, wellness, and chronic disease management programs, and is working with clients, physicians, and others to develop ways to increase prevention and treatment of substance use disorders. As our senior design sponsor, they gave us the opportunity to join in their efforts to study potential relationships between determinants and the opioid epidemic.</p>
            
        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>The opioid crisis is an epidemic that we are tackling because of its widespread effect in communities everywhere around the United States. Epidemics are unlike endemics, which are events that remain steady-state among certain populations within a particular geographic region, and pandemics, which are events that occur worldwide and can spread quickly. Instead, instances of epidemics like the opioid crisis can quickly appear in particular areas and eventually subside. That is why the development of tools that can make predictions on an area’s susceptibility to an opioid crisis is important. It can help prepare vulnerable areas to be vigilant.</p><p>Addiction is often portrayed as a problem for certain communities, but that isn’t always the case. Opioid addiction and dependence is a risk for every individual, even when everyone’s susceptibility and environments may be different. With the opioid crisis, data shows that it is spread all throughout the United States. We want to show the prevalence of the epidemic across all communities and to find any potential correlations that can link risk with social determinants. Our goal is to produce insightful results for professional analysis on the opioid crisis and to make it an educational tool for the public.</p>
        
        <h2>Vision</h2>
        <p>The overall vision of our project is to research how we can use technology to predict the spread of epidemics such as the opioid crisis, in order to identify areas that are in need of resources. We hope that our exploration of how machine learning can be used to build predictive models will give Cigna more insight into its potential. The capabilities of technology are constantly growing and it’s important that we continue to expand our knowledge on how to utilize it.</p>

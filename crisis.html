      <h2>What are opioids?</h2>
      <p>Opioids are a class of drugs naturally found in the opium poppy plant. They produce a variety of effects on the brain including the relief of pain. Some of the most commonly used opioids include prescription opioids, such as OxyContin and Vicodin, fentanyl, and heroin. Fentanyl is a dangerous opioid that is usually used for patients with severe pain. It has been a leading cause in opioid overdose because it is cheap and easy to produce illegally and it is more potent than heroin. Opioids are highly addictive and thus many people end up building a dependency on them.</p>

      <h2>What is the opioid epidemic?</h2>  
      <p>The opioid epidemic specifically refers to the growing number of deaths and hospitalizations from opioids. It has taken the United States by storm over the past two decades since opioids were first legalized and released to the public as pain management and relief drugs. While they have had tremendous medical success in some cases, they have also left many people addicted. They are highly addictive and it is known that about 21% who are prescribed opioids end up abusing them at some point. Drug overdoses have become a leading cause of death in the United States and it affects people from communities all over.</p>

      <h2>How did the epidemic start?</h2>
      <p>It can be traced back to the late 90s, when pharmaceutical companies started looking for new pain killers. They began to push synthetic and semi-synthetic opioids to doctors and claimed that the drugs were either less- or non-addictive compared to morphine and that it had no dangerous side effects. As a result, doctors also began to advocate for these drugs because they didn't see any visible negative effects on prescribed patients. This growth in the prescription opioid business directly pushed the distribution of opioids to levels that remain to this day, contributing to this dangerous epidemic.</p>
      
      <h2>Why do we want to help?</h2>
      <p>The opioid crisis is a problem that affects many people in the United States today. Many lives have been destroyed by battling the addiction to opioids, both prescription and illegal. There needs to be a change for the better, to increase the efforts to reduce opioid addiction. Our goal with this project is to provide a website that provides predictions, insights, and information to people who are want to learn more about the crisis.
